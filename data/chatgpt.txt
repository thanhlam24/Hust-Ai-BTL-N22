If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for them as we are waiting for the bus or underground. However, in another way, the car costs more money than public transport.
With a car, we can just stay by ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like, and we don't need to be around people that are unknown. But if we choose public transport, we can meet friends or family, so both transportation options are good, and cars don't necessarily need to compete with public transport.
However, even when it's true that it's the faster option, you must be very careful at times to get off a plane.
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation, obviously, you have to take a boat.
There isn't a comparison in watching the changes in the landscape through a window, enjoying the way that you are traveling, and the best part, the cheapest way to get away for some days and break the routine.
I went to the abandoned house and started to think about the best way to make his life miserable. I spent the next two weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer.
As I didn't find anything, I went to the place where he lives and started to look for some information about his life. I found people who he cares about. As I continued to go to his house, I noticed he always goes to the same house. So I decided to follow him to the house, and I found out he was dating a girl. She might be his girlfriend. So I finally got an idea: I would drive him crazy, just as he did with me. That way, she will think he had problems on his mind and left him. But soon I thought about it again and realized that if I did that, she would try to help him, and they would be more united. So I decided to drive them both crazy, almost to the border of death, just as he did with me!
I screamed; my anger had dominated my mind. I did not have any longer control over my actions. I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do, but I could not control myself. The only thing I could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revenge, the best revenge.
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger. I had made a decision; I was going to do it. If he dedicated four years of his life torturing me and not wanting me to be happy, I would take the time necessary for him to have a miserable life, and I won't stop until I had accomplished my goal.
I graduated from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.
I am interested in looking after children and playing with them.

This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and the exponential growth in their sales figures. With low-budget private cars in the picture, the scenario has drastically changed in the past 10 years.
In our school or village football stadium, I spend a lot of time every day.
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport: "You must believe in yourself."
Hello, my friend. You regret that you weren't there with me. I'll try to describe everything precisely because I know that you care.
It was a long time ago; however, I still keep the rhythm in my body!
Around the city, you can find many places where people throw fridges, kitchen items, "amianto" (asbestos), old things, or furniture.
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday; only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party. I think that this day was one of the worst days of my life.
I'm learning a lot, and the students are very friendly.
But I need to study harder because I want to pass the exam, and it's very difficult.
Technology has changed people's lives very much. In fact, we can think about how different our life is compared to either our parents' or our grandparents' lives. For example, my parents didn't watch TV because there wasn't any TV in the world when they were young. But it isn't the only difference; we can think of the mobile phone, the computer, and at least the internet. Our grandparents wouldn't imagine a strange machine like a computer in their life.
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation.
Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect their own life.
In conclusion, investments in developing public transport will be increased considerably. Public services of traveling have a bright potential, and its stance in the future can't be replaceable.

A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apocalypse should happen, he would be prepared because he has been watching "The Walking Dead" for some time now. So, in his eyes, he learned how (not) to act in that case.
Apart from educational content, there are so many foul contents, business advertisements, and fake information on TV that citizens won't be able to distinguish right from wrong.
First of all, you need to afford to buy it. After that, you must pay for the insurance, council tax, and mechanic bills, and so on.
Whereas in public transport, you only have to pay the ticket. You don't have to drive, and if the bus, train, or whatever vehicle you use breaks down, it isn't your responsibility.

I like my math teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand.
I said that because when I was eleven, my best friend had an operation on her back. Before the operation, she came with me, and every day I had to wait for her because she spent a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hair. I hated that!

It is easier than you think.
Every Sunday, we do a mutual cooperation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves.
While we recycle inorganic rubbish too.
Firstly, I agree with the given statement that there would be a tough time for public transportation in the near future because people want privacy as well as freedom, which is quite impossible in public transportation. 
As much as possible, city areas or towns with mismanaged routines who travel by public transportation. As a consequence, generally, people avoid traveling by public transportation. Finally, I can say that there are various modes of transportation available
which play an important role in giving tough competition to the government. As a result of this, consumers get more benefits like lower fares, privacy, freedom, and safe traveling. In addition, many automobile companies are launching new cars with affordable prices, which entices people to use more and more private vehicles.
Usually, there are generation problems; sons don't understand parents and vice versa. But dialoguing and listening to emotions and facts, everyone can have another point of view.
It will be very cool to see the last part of Mockingjay!
In my opinion, it's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports.
He took the money the second day. He finished the registration and started writing the story. After a long time spent writing and doing a good job, he went to give his story to the international student magazine office. He found out there was a notice on the door saying that the competition had been canceled. He came back very sad and told me what happened. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.
Vandalism in Patras has increased a lot. 
In my opinion, the police should stop vandalism. 
What they will do in the future, they'll see, like in a fog.
Secondly, such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional spheres. 
Also, they would have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer activities. 
This year's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new power for future education.
I believe that there is no future for public transport. Using trains is more convenient and less expensive. Also, to decrease the carbon gases affecting the ozone, people should be aware of the effects of using public transportation on the economy and environment. Governments should encourage people to use other ways for transport. This subject should be addressed in all media to learn and encourage people to use the right way for transport.
Because we are Chinese, why should we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language?
Woolypools is a specialist meal restaurant.
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming population, much agricultural land, forest, and ocean have been used to destroy and build more structures and transport networks.
To start with, there is a wide range of troublesome issues that may be leading to this phenomenon. 
Additionally, people now continue to destroy more agriculture and forests to satisfy all their needs, which will destroy the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity, especially the endangered species.
According to the problems mentioned above, various approaches that the government should adopt to deal with this problem. First of all, reducing building structures from now on, planting more trees instead.
Sustainable development should be awareness to all humans and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals. 
To sum up, this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before things get worse, and the governments have to take responsibility for that.
I made that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English, and I did not have the level that I wanted. So when I heard about that opportunity, I said yes.
I want to say something about learning the English language; it is hard to get to me for the next reasons: 
First reason; the grammar that learners, teachers, or institutes teach is like the Spanish language, my native language. 
What I want to say is it is very difficult to understand the conjunction of verbs in Spanish, just imagine the same but not in your native language. 
Second reason: In English syntax, the structure for constructing paragraphs or sentences, the verb is written before the subject, but not always. Which is the rule?
I can recommend you to my uncle's company to do a job.
According to my age, evening activities are not a problem for me, and I played many sports during my life, such as soccer, volleyball, etc. 
To sum it up, I still consider having your car is way safer and more convenient. 
Even if it will have happened, there are many people who can't get a car because it is too expensive, not only for buying but also for fuel, service, and so forth.
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives remains quite a dilemma for the ignorant. 
Alongside its development, the ability to travel has eased to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another. 
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism, as well as with the idea of globalization since a traveler is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. 
There are countries, such as Greece or Bulgaria, in which the economy relies merely on tourism. 
If tourism influences the economy, it thereby influences the environment, and if it influences the environment, it influences transport. How? People become more careful with their historical sites, thus preserving them; Transport is developed both on a small and large scale:
At a small scale, in cities, in a way that will allow both citizens and tourists to reach important places more efficiently.
I would like to go to a new artistic roller skating competition, although in my city, there aren't a lot of competitions of this kind. If I had the possibility of going, I would have already purchased the tickets.
In the beginning, I went to the kindergarten, and they taught me skiing.
My father took me between his knees because I could skate without falling, and it was fun.
I had my first snowboard lesson, and I loved it.
I enjoy snowboarding because you feel free when you are riding down the slope.
You are very happy, and sometimes I sing a song, and the world is perfect. 
Is there no future for public transport? Is this a valid claim or not?
I think that it all depends on the development.
Yes, I agree. If you plan the travel for a long distance and an extended period, you would prefer to do it by car. Firstly, you'll spend less time, your journey will be comfortable, and you'll have the possibility to stop anywhere and for as long as you need.
But if we are talking about traveling across your city, would you prefer public transport or a car?
I think that this is a question for everyone, and the answer can't be the same for all. Someone can use public transport, benefiting not only financially but also contributing to the environment. However, some people don't like to use public transport because they spend more time traveling or simply don't enjoy traveling with others.
Guide the people by providing them with information, details, and guidelines about pollution.
I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant; its name is "Lemon." I go there every week because it offers different food from any other restaurants. I like the crispy chicken with garlic sauce – it's an excellent choice for me. My favorite appetizer is sausage, and for dessert, I prefer the "Vadge" cake with chocolate sauce. I feel at ease when I go there, and I enjoy classical music during lunch.
About the service, it's very good, and all the staff are respectable. I can't imagine one week without going there; it drives me nuts. I advise anyone to go there and enjoy some time. Also, this restaurant has a relative advantage in terms of hygiene; it's excellent. Despite all of these advantages, prices are not expensive.
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am playing with my team, I am in another world where I can be free and happy. Apart from this, when I am feeling down, it serves as a distraction from university.
You should try practicing; it's so much fun. But I advise you, it's not easy at first. However, you have to try many times, just like you should in life.
On weekdays, I get out of bed at 7 in the morning to go to work, which starts at 9 AM.
