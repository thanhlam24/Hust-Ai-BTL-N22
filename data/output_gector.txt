as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transport a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various mode of transportation available

As a result of this , consumer gets more benefits like lower fares , privacy , freedom and safe travelling.in addition , many automobile companies launcing new cars at affordable prices , which encourages people to use more and more private vechile .

The first reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my native Languaje .

Second reason . in the English syntaxis , the structure for constructing paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always . Which is the rule ?

Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
Alongside its development , the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the econmy , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . How?people become more careful at their historical sites , this way preserving them;Transport is developed both on a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently .

but if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is a question for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , because , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .
